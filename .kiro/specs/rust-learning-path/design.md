# Design Document: Rust Learning Path

## Overview

This design document outlines the structure and implementation details for a comprehensive Rust learning project. The project follows a progressive learning path from basic to expert levels, using hands-on projects to reinforce learning through practical experience. The design emphasizes the "experience -> repeat -> learning" methodology, ensuring concepts are introduced, practiced, and mastered through real-world applications.

## Architecture

The learning path is structured as a hierarchical system with the following components:

1. **Learning Levels**: The overall structure divides content into distinct levels (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert).
2. **Learning Modules**: Each level contains multiple learning modules focused on specific concept clusters.
3. **Projects**: Each module includes one or more hands-on projects that apply the concepts.
4. **Steps**: Projects are broken down into manageable implementation steps.
5. **Concepts**: Each step highlights specific Rust concepts being applied.
6. **Tests**: Validation mechanisms to ensure understanding before progression.

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Project Structure

Each project in the learning path will follow a consistent structure:

```
project-name/

├── src/                # Source code directory
│   └── main.rs         # Entry point for the application
├── tests/              # Test directory
│   └── integration_tests.rs  # Integration tests
├── Cargo.toml          # Project dependencies and metadata
└── CONCEPTS.md         # Detailed explanation of Rust concepts used
```

### 2. Learning Level Interface

Each learning level will be presented with a consistent interface:

- **Level Overview**: Description, prerequisites, and learning outcomes
- **Module List**: List of modules contained in the level
- **Progression Criteria**: Clear criteria for when to advance to the next level
- **Resources**: Level-specific resources and references

### 3. Module Interface

Each module will include:

- **Module Overview**: Concepts covered and learning objectives
- **Project List**: Projects that apply the module concepts
- **Concept Reference**: Detailed explanations of all concepts introduced
- **Assessment Criteria**: How mastery of the module is evaluated

### 4. Project Interface

Each project will include:

- **Project Brief**: Overview and objectives
- **Step-by-Step Guide**: Detailed implementation instructions
- **Concept Highlights**: Rust concepts applied in each step
- **Extension Challenges**: Additional tasks to reinforce learning
- **Tests**: Validation tests to verify correct implementation
