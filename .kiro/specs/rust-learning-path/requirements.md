# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive Rust learning project designed to help users progress from basic to advanced concepts through practical, hands-on experience. The project follows the "experience -> repeat -> learning" methodology, where users build real-world applications with increasing complexity to reinforce their understanding of Rust concepts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Progressive Learning Structure

**User Story:** As a Rust learner, I want a structured learning path that progresses from basic to advanced concepts, so that I can build my knowledge incrementally without feeling overwhelmed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user starts the learning path THEN the system SHALL provide clearly defined learning levels (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert).
2. WHEN the user completes a level THEN the system SHALL provide a clear transition to the next level.
3. WHEN the user views a level THEN the system SHALL display prerequisites and expected outcomes for that level.
4. WHEN the user is at any point in the learning path THEN the system SHALL provide context about where they are in the overall learning journey.

### Requirement 2: Hands-on Project-Based Learning

**User Story:** As a Rust learner, I want to learn through building real-world projects, so that I can gain practical experience while learning the language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user starts a learning level THEN the system SHALL provide at least one complete project to build.
2. WHEN the user works on a project THEN the system SHALL break down the project into manageable steps with clear instructions.
3. WHEN the user completes a project step THEN the system SHALL explain the Rust concepts applied in that step.
4. WHEN the user completes a project THEN the system SHALL provide extension challenges to reinforce learning.
5. WHEN the user builds a project THEN the system SHALL ensure the project demonstrates practical applications of Rust in real-world scenarios.

### Requirement 3: Comprehensive Coverage of Rust Concepts

**User Story:** As a Rust learner, I want to learn all essential Rust concepts from basic syntax to advanced features, so that I can become proficient in the language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user completes the Basic level THEN the system SHALL ensure they understand Rust fundamentals (syntax, data types, control flow, functions, error handling, and basic ownership).
2. WHEN the user completes the Intermediate level THEN the system SHALL ensure they understand more complex concepts (structs, enums, pattern matching, advanced ownership, traits, generics, and collections).
3. WHEN the user completes the Advanced level THEN the system SHALL ensure they understand advanced topics (concurrency, unsafe Rust, advanced traits, macros, and FFI).
4. WHEN the user completes the Expert level THEN the system SHALL ensure they understand specialized topics (async programming, advanced memory management, compiler internals, and performance optimization).
5. WHEN the user learns a concept THEN the system SHALL provide both theoretical explanation and practical application.

### Requirement 4: Reinforcement Through Repetition

**User Story:** As a Rust learner, I want opportunities to revisit and reinforce concepts through different applications, so that I can solidify my understanding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user learns a new concept THEN the system SHALL provide multiple examples and exercises applying that concept.
2. WHEN the user progresses to a new level THEN the system SHALL incorporate concepts from previous levels in new projects.
3. WHEN the user completes a project THEN the system SHALL provide variations or extensions that apply the same concepts in different contexts.
4. WHEN the user struggles with a concept THEN the system SHALL provide alternative explanations and additional practice opportunities.

### Requirement 5: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a Rust learner, I want to validate my understanding through tests and challenges, so that I can ensure I've mastered each concept before moving on.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user completes a learning module THEN the system SHALL provide tests to validate understanding.
2. WHEN the user builds a project THEN the system SHALL include test-driven development practices.
3. WHEN the user completes a level THEN the system SHALL provide a capstone project that combines multiple concepts from that level.
4. WHEN the user writes code THEN the system SHALL encourage best practices for testing in Rust.

### Requirement 6: Documentation and Reference Materials

**User Story:** As a Rust learner, I want comprehensive documentation and reference materials, so that I can look up information when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user encounters a new concept THEN the system SHALL provide links to official Rust documentation.
2. WHEN the user works on a project THEN the system SHALL include well-commented code examples.
3. WHEN the user completes a project THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of concepts covered and resources for further reading.
4. WHEN the user needs to reference previous material THEN the system SHALL provide an organized index of all concepts covered.

### Requirement 7: Community Integration

**User Story:** As a Rust learner, I want to be aware of Rust community resources and practices, so that I can engage with the broader Rust ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user progresses in their learning THEN the system SHALL introduce relevant community resources (forums, chat channels, conferences).
2. WHEN the user builds projects THEN the system SHALL follow community best practices and coding standards.
3. WHEN the user reaches the Intermediate level THEN the system SHALL introduce popular Rust crates and how to use them.
4. WHEN the user reaches the Advanced level THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on contributing to open source Rust projects.
