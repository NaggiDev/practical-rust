# Module 3: Basic Ownership

Welcome to Module 3 of the Basic Level! This module introduces you to Rust's ownership system, one of the language's most distinctive and powerful features.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will:

- Understand Rust's ownership rules
- Learn about borrowing and references
- Grasp the concept of lifetimes (at a basic level)
- Work with structs and enums
- Implement methods on your own types

## Concepts Covered

- Ownership and move semantics
- Borrowing and references
- Mutable and immutable references
- The slice type
- Structs and struct methods
- Enums and pattern matching
- Basic lifetime concepts

## Projects

### [Basic To-Do List Application](todo-app/README.md)

Build a command-line to-do list application that allows users to manage tasks.

**Skills practiced:**
- Creating custom types with structs and enums
- Implementing methods on structs
- Managing ownership of data
- Using vectors and other collections
- Persisting data to files
- Handling user input and commands
