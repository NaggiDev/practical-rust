# Module 4: Basic Level Capstone

Welcome to Module 4 of the Basic Level! This module features a capstone project that brings together all the concepts you've learned in the Basic Level.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will:

- Apply all Basic Level concepts in a comprehensive project
- Gain experience building a complete application from scratch
- Practice test-driven development
- Learn to structure a larger Rust project
- Implement error handling throughout an application

## Concepts Covered

- All Basic Level concepts, including:
  - Rust syntax and basic language constructs
  - Functions and error handling
  - Ownership and borrowing
  - Structs and enums
  - Collections
  - File I/O
  - Testing

## Projects

### [Basic Level Capstone Project](capstone/README.md)

Build a command-line note-taking application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes with tags and search functionality.

**Skills practiced:**
- Designing a multi-component application
- Implementing CRUD operations
- Working with files for data persistence
- Creating a command-line interface
- Handling errors throughout the application
- Writing tests for all components
- Applying ownership concepts correctly

## Extension Challenges

After completing the basic capstone project, try these extension challenges:

1. Add support for formatting notes with Markdown
2. Implement note encryption for sensitive information
3. Create a simple backup and restore system
4. Add a simple TUI (Text User Interface) using a crate like `cursive` or `tui-rs`
