# Basic Level - Rust Fundamentals

Welcome to the Basic Level of the Rust Learning Path! This level is designed to introduce you to the fundamental concepts of Rust programming.

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge in any language
- [Rust installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on your system
- A code editor or IDE with Rust support

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this level, you will:

- Understand Rust syntax, variables, data types, and control flow
- Learn how to handle errors using Result and Option types
- Grasp the basics of Rust's ownership system
- Build simple command-line applications
- Work with files and text processing
- Implement basic data structures

## Modules
