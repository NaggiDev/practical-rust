# Advanced Level - Systems Programming in Rust

Welcome to the Advanced Level of the Rust Learning Path! This level focuses on advanced Rust features and systems programming concepts.

## Prerequisites

- Completion of the [Intermediate Level](../intermediate/index.md)
- Strong understanding of Rust's ownership system
- Experience with traits, generics, and error handling
- Familiarity with collections and iterators
- Comfort with building multi-component Rust applications

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this level, you will:

- Master concurrent programming in Rust
- Understand and safely use unsafe Rust
- Implement advanced traits and trait objects
- Create and use macros for metaprogramming
- Work with Foreign Function Interfaces (FFI)
- Build high-performance systems components
- Develop custom memory management solutions

## Modules

### [Module 1: Concurrency](module1/index.md)

Master threads, mutexes, and atomic operations for safe concurrent programming.

**Projects:**
- [Thread Pool Implementation](module1/thread-pool/README.md)

### [Module 2: Unsafe Rust](module2/index.md)

Learn when and how to use unsafe Rust safely.

**Projects:**
- [Custom Memory Allocator](module2/memory-allocator/README.md)

### [Module 3: FFI and Interoperability](module3/index.md)

Bridge Rust with other languages and systems.

**Projects:**
- [C Library Binding](module3/c-binding/README.md)

### [Module 4: Macros and Metaprogramming](module4/index.md)

Create powerful abstractions with declarative and procedural macros.

**Projects:**
- [Domain-Specific Language](module4/dsl/README.md)

### [Module 5: Capstone Project](module5/index.md)

Apply all the concepts learned in the Advanced Level to build a comprehensive project.

**Projects:**
- [Advanced Level Capstone Project](module5/capstone/README.md)

## Next Steps

After completing all modules and projects in the Advanced Level, you should proceed to the [Expert Level](../expert/index.md) to master specialized Rust applications and advanced topics.
