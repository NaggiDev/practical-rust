**Objective**: Build upon your thread pool implementation to add work stealing capabilities.

**Tasks**:
1. Implement per-worker task queues using lock-free data structures
2. Add work stealing algorithm for load balancing
3. Integrate custom memory allocator for task storage
4. Add performance monitoring and metrics

**Key Learning Points**:
- Work stealing improves load distribution
- Lock-free data structures reduce contention
- Custom allocators can improve performance
- Metrics help optimize concurrent systems

### Step 2: Lock-Free Task Queue Implementation

**Concepts Applied**: Unsafe Rust, atomic operations, memory ordering

**Objective**: Implement a high-performance, lock-free task queue.

**Tasks**:
1. Design lock-free queue using atomic pointers
2. Implement safe abstractions over unsafe operations
3. Handle memory reclamation safely
4. Add comprehensive testing for concurrent access

**Key Learning Points**:
- Lock-free programming requires careful memory ordering
- ABA problem and hazard pointers
- Safe abstractions over unsafe code
- Testing concurrent data structures

### Step 3: Custom Memory Allocator Integration

**Concepts Applied**: Unsafe Rust, memory management, performance optimization

**Objective**: Integrate a custom allocator optimized for task execution.

**Tasks**:
1. Adapt your memory allocator for task-specific workloads
2. Implement memory pools for different task sizes
3. Add allocation tracking and debugging features
4. Optimize for concurrent allocation patterns

**Key Learning Points**:
- Specialized allocators can improve performance
- Memory pools reduce fragmentation
- Concurrent allocation requires synchronization
- Profiling guides optimization decisions

### Step 4: FFI Integration for Performance-Critical Operations

**Concepts Applied**: FFI, unsafe Rust, performance optimization

**Objective**: Integrate C library for computationally intensive operations.

**Tasks**:
1. Create C library with mathematical and string operations
2. Implement safe Rust wrappers with proper error handling
3. Add callback mechanisms for progress reporting
4. Optimize data transfer between Rust and C

**Key Learning Points**:
- FFI can provide performance benefits for specific operations
- Safe wrappers maintain Rust's safety guarantees
- Callbacks enable communication from C to Rust
- Data marshalling affects performance

### Step 5: Task Definition DSL

**Concepts Applied**: Macros, code generation, domain-specific languages

**Objective**: Create a DSL for defining and configuring tasks.

**Tasks**:
1. Design macro syntax for task definitions
2. Implement code generation for task structures
3. Add compile-time validation and optimization
4. Create configuration macros for engine setup

**Key Learning Points**:
- DSLs improve code readability and maintainability
- Macros enable compile-time code generation
- Validation at compile-time prevents runtime errors
- Configuration DSLs simplify complex setups

### Step 6: Advanced Traits and Type System

**Objective**: Design a flexible trait system for task execution and resource management.

**Tasks**:
1. Define traits for different task types and execution strategies
2. Implement trait objects for dynamic dispatch
3. Use associated types for type-safe resource management
4. Create trait hierarchies for extensibility

**Key Learning Points**:

- Regression tests prevent performance degradation

## Example Usage

Here's how the completed system would be used:

```rust
use capstone_project::*;

// Define tasks using the DSL
task_definition! {
    MathTask {
        operation: Add | Multiply | Factorial,
        operands: Vec<i64>,
        result: i64,
    }
    
    StringTask {
        operation: Reverse | Uppercase | Hash,
        input: String,
        output: String,
    }
}

// Configure the engine
engine_config! {
    TaskEngine {
        workers: 8,
        queue_size: 1000,
        allocator: CustomAllocator::new(1024 * 1024), // 1MB pool
        enable_work_stealing: true,
        metrics: true,
    }
}

fn main() -> Result<(), EngineError> {
    let engine = TaskEngine::new()?;
    
    // Submit tasks
    let math_task = MathTask::new(Add, vec![1, 2, 3]);
    let string_task = StringTask::new(Reverse, "hello".to_string());
    
    let math_result = engine.submit(math_task).await?;
    let string_result = engine.submit(string_task).await?;
    
    println!("Math result: {}", math_result);
    println!("String result: {}", string_result);
    
    // Get performance metrics
    let metrics = engine.metrics();
    println!("Tasks completed: {}", metrics.tasks_completed);
    println!("Average execution time: {:?}", metrics.avg_execution_time);
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## Performance Goals

Your implementation should achieve:
- **Throughput**: Handle 10,000+ tasks per second
- **Latency**: Sub-millisecond task dispatch
- **Memory Efficiency**: Minimal allocation overhead
- **Scalability**: Linear performance scaling with worker threads
- **Safety**: Zero memory safety violations under stress testing

Once you complete the basic implementation, try these advanced challenges:

1. **Distributed Execution**: Extend the engine to work across multiple machines
