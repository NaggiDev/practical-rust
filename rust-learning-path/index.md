# Rust Learning Path

Welcome to the Rust Learning Path! This comprehensive curriculum is designed to take you from a beginner to an expert in Rust programming through hands-on, project-based learning.

## Learning Levels

Choose your level to begin:

1. [Basic Level](basic/index.md) - Rust fundamentals and basic programming concepts
   - Perfect for beginners or those new to Rust
   - Focus on syntax, basic types, control flow, and simple data structures

2. [Intermediate Level](intermediate/index.md) - More complex Rust features and programming patterns
   - For those who understand Rust basics and want to deepen their knowledge
   - Focus on ownership, borrowing, traits, generics, and error handling patterns

3. [Advanced Level](advanced/index.md) - Advanced Rust features and systems programming
   - For experienced Rust programmers looking to master advanced concepts
   - Focus on concurrency, unsafe Rust, advanced traits, and macros

4. [Expert Level](expert/index.md) - Specialized Rust applications and advanced topics
   - For those seeking to become Rust experts
   - Focus on async programming, compiler internals, and performance optimization

## Learning Philosophy

This learning path follows the "experience -> repeat -> learning" methodology:

1. **Experience**: Build real-world applications with increasing complexity
2. **Repeat**: Revisit core concepts in different contexts to reinforce understanding
3. **Learning**: Solidify theoretical knowledge through practical application

## How to Use This Learning Path

1. Start with the Basic Level and progress sequentially
2. Each level contains multiple modules with projects and step-by-step instructions
3. Complete all projects in a level before moving to the next
4. Use the provided tests to validate your understanding
5. Explore the extension challenges for additional practice

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge in any language
- [Rust installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on your system
- A code editor or IDE with Rust support
- Willingness to learn through hands-on practice
