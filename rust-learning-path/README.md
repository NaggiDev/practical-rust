# Rust Learning Path

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive learning path for the Rust programming language, designed to take learners from basic concepts to expert-level proficiency through hands-on, project-based learning.

## Learning Philosophy

This learning path follows the "experience -> repeat -> learning" methodology, where:

1. **Experience**: You'll build real-world applications with increasing complexity
2. **Repeat**: Core concepts are revisited in different contexts to reinforce understanding
3. **Learning**: Theoretical knowledge is solidified through practical application

## Learning Path Structure

The learning path is organized into four progressive levels:

### 1. Basic Level
- Focus: Rust fundamentals and basic programming concepts
- Projects: Command Line Calculator, File System Explorer, Simple Text Processor, Basic To-Do List Application
- Concepts: Syntax, variables, data types, control flow, functions, error handling, basic ownership

### 2. Intermediate Level
- Focus: More complex Rust features and programming patterns
- Projects: Library Management System, Multi-threaded Web Scraper, Custom Data Structure, Command Line Database Tool
- Concepts: Advanced ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, traits, generics, collections, iterators, error handling patterns

### 3. Advanced Level
- Focus: Advanced Rust features and systems programming
- Projects: Thread Pool Implementation, Custom Memory Allocator, C Library Binding, Domain-Specific Language
- Concepts: Concurrency, unsafe Rust, advanced traits, macros, FFI

### 4. Expert Level
- Focus: Specialized Rust applications and advanced topics
- Projects: Asynchronous Network Server, Custom Runtime, Compiler Plugin, High-Performance Data Processing
- Concepts: Async programming, advanced memory management, compiler internals, performance optimization

## How to Use This Learning Path

1. Start with the Basic Level and progress sequentially
2. Each level contains multiple projects with step-by-step instructions
3. Complete all projects in a level before moving to the next
4. Use the provided tests to validate your understanding
5. Explore the extension challenges for additional practice

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge in any language
- Rust installed on your system ([Installation Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))
- A code editor or IDE with Rust support
- Willingness to learn through hands-on practice

## Community Resources

As you progress through this learning path, you'll be introduced to various Rust community resources to help you engage with the broader Rust ecosystem.
