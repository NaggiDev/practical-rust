- ✅ **Requirement 2.3**: Detailed explanations of Rust concepts
- ✅ **Requirement 3.2**: Intermediate-level concepts (advanced ownership, traits, generics, collections)

## Ready for Use

The CLI Database Tool project is complete and ready for intermediate Rust learners. It provides:

- A working command-line database application
- Comprehensive documentation and learning materials
- Extensive test coverage
- Clear examples of advanced Rust patterns
- Extension challenges for further learning

Students can now:
1. Study the code to understand the concepts
2. Run the tests to see the application in action
