# Intermediate Level - Advanced Rust Features

Welcome to the Intermediate Level of the Rust Learning Path! This level builds on the fundamentals and introduces more complex Rust features and programming patterns.

## Prerequisites

- Completion of the [Basic Level](../basic/index.md)
- Understanding of Rust fundamentals (syntax, basic types, control flow)
- Familiarity with basic ownership concepts
- Experience with simple Rust projects

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this level, you will:

- Master Rust's ownership system, including borrowing and lifetimes
- Understand and implement traits and generics
- Work with collections and iterators
- Develop robust error handling patterns
- Build multi-threaded applications
- Create custom data structures
- Implement persistence with databases

## Modules

### [Module 1: Advanced Ownership](module1/index.md)

Deep dive into borrowing, lifetimes, and reference counting.

**Projects:**
- [Library Management System](module1/library-system/README.md)

### [Module 2: Traits and Generics](custom-data-structure/README.md)

Learn how to create flexible and reusable code with traits and generics.

**Projects:**
- [Custom Data Structure Implementation](custom-data-structure/README.md)

### [Module 3: Collections and Concurrency](multi-threaded-web-scraper/README.md)

Work with complex data structures and multi-threaded programming.

**Projects:**
- [Multi-threaded Web Scraper](multi-threaded-web-scraper/README.md)

### [Module 4: Error Handling Patterns](module4/index.md)

Develop robust error handling strategies.

**Projects:**
- [Command Line Database Tool](module4/database-tool/README.md)

### [Module 5: Capstone Project](module5/index.md)

Apply all the concepts learned in the Intermediate Level to build a comprehensive project.

**Projects:**
- [Intermediate Level Capstone Project](module5/capstone/README.md)

## Next Steps

After completing all modules and projects in the Intermediate Level, you should proceed to the [Advanced Level](../advanced/index.md) to master advanced Rust concepts.
