## Ownership

### Overview

Ownership is one of Rust's most unique and important features. It's a set of rules that govern how Rust programs manage memory. In Rust, each value has a single owner, and when the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped (memory is freed).

### How it's used in this project

In the Library Management System, ownership is a central concept. The `Library` struct owns all the books in the system, while temporarily lending them to users through Rust's borrowing mechanism.

```rust
pub struct Library {
    books: Vec<Book>,       // Library owns all books
    users: Vec<User>,       // Library owns all user records
}

impl Library {
    pub fn add_book(&mut self, book: Book) {
        // Library takes ownership of the book
        self.books.push(book);
    }
}
```

### Key points to understand

- When data is passed to a function without references, ownership is transferred
- When the owner goes out of scope, the data is automatically dropped
- Only one part of your code can own a piece of data at a time
- Ownership can be transferred (moved) but not shared without references

### Common pitfalls

- Trying to use data after it has been moved
- Creating complex ownership structures that are difficult to manage
- Not understanding when ownership is transferred vs. borrowed

## Borrowing

### Overview

Borrowing is Rust's mechanism for accessing data without taking ownership. It allows multiple parts of your code to access the same data without copying or moving it. Rust has strict rules about borrowing to prevent data races and ensure memory safety.

### How it's used in this project

The Library Management System uses borrowing extensively to allow users to borrow books without transferring ownership of the books from the library.

```rust
impl Library {
    // Returns a reference to a book, allowing the caller to "borrow" it
    pub fn find_book_by_title(&self, title: &str) -> Option<&Book> {
        self.books.iter().find(|book| book.title == title)
    }
    
    // Allows modifying a book through a mutable reference
    pub fn mark_book_as_borrowed(&mut self, book_id: usize, user_id: usize) -> Result<(), LibraryError> {
        if let Some(book) = self.books.get_mut(book_id) {
            if book.is_available {
                book.is_available = false;
                book.borrowed_by = Some(user_id);
                Ok(())
            } else {
                Err(LibraryError::BookNotAvailable)
            }
        } else {
            Err(LibraryError::BookNotFound)
        }
    }
}
```

### Key points to understand

- References are non-owning pointers to data
- Immutable references (`&T`) allow reading but not modifying data
- Mutable references (`&mut T`) allow both reading and modifying data
- Rust enforces the rule: either multiple immutable references OR one mutable reference
- References must always be valid (no dangling references)

### Common pitfalls

- Trying to modify data through an immutable reference
- Having multiple mutable references to the same data
- Fighting with the borrow checker when implementing complex data structures

## Lifetimes

### Overview

Lifetimes are Rust's way of ensuring that references are always valid. They're a form of annotation that helps the compiler understand how long references should be valid and prevent the use of dangling references.

### How it's used in this project

In the Library Management System, lifetimes are crucial for managing references between books and users, especially when implementing the borrowing system.

```rust
// A struct that contains references needs lifetime annotations
pub struct BookLoan<'a, 'b> {
    book: &'a Book,       // Reference to a book
    user: &'b User,       // Reference to a user
    due_date: DateTime<Utc>,
}

impl<'a, 'b> BookLoan<'a, 'b> {
    // Function that returns a reference with a specific lifetime
    pub fn get_book(&self) -> &'a Book {
        self.book
    }
}
```

### Key points to understand

- Lifetimes ensure references don't outlive the data they point to
- Lifetime annotations don't change how long data lives
- They describe the relationships between the lifetimes of multiple references
- The compiler often infers lifetimes (elision), but sometimes needs explicit annotations

### Common pitfalls

- Struggling to understand lifetime syntax
- Creating complex lifetime relationships that are difficult to manage
- Not understanding when lifetimes need to be explicit vs. when they can be elided

## Structs and Methods

### Overview

Structs are custom data types that let you package together and name multiple related values. Methods are functions associated with a particular struct, enum, or trait object.

### How it's used in this project

The Library Management System uses structs to represent books, users, and the library itself, with methods to implement their behavior.

```rust
pub struct Book {
    id: usize,
    title: String,
    author: String,
    isbn: String,
    is_available: bool,
    borrowed_by: Option<usize>,
}

impl Book {
    // Constructor method
    pub fn new(id: usize, title: String, author: String, isbn: String) -> Self {
        Self {
            id,
            title,
            author,
            isbn,
            is_available: true,
            borrowed_by: None,
        }
    }
    
    // Method to check if the book is available
    pub fn is_available(&self) -> bool {
        self.is_available
    }
}
```

### Key points to understand

- Structs group related data together
- Methods are functions associated with a specific type
- The `self` parameter represents the instance the method is called on
- `&self` borrows the instance immutably, `&mut self` borrows it mutably, and `self` takes ownership

### Common pitfalls

- Confusing methods (called with dot notation) with associated functions (called with :: notation)
- Not understanding when to use `self`, `&self`, or `&mut self`
- Creating overly complex structs that are difficult to work with

## Error Handling

### Overview

Rust has a robust error handling system centered around the `Result<T, E>` and `Option<T>` types. This approach forces developers to explicitly handle potential errors, making programs more reliable.

### How it's used in this project

The Library Management System uses custom error types and the Result type to handle various error conditions that might occur during library operations.

```rust
#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
pub enum LibraryError {
    #[error("Book not found")]
    BookNotFound,
    
    #[error("Book is not available for borrowing")]
    BookNotAvailable,
    
    #[error("User not found")]
    UserNotFound,
    
    #[error("Invalid operation: {0}")]
    InvalidOperation(String),
}

impl Library {
    pub fn borrow_book(&mut self, book_id: usize, user_id: usize) -> Result<(), LibraryError> {
        // Find the book
        let book = self.books.get_mut(book_id).ok_or(LibraryError::BookNotFound)?;
        
        // Check if it's available
        if !book.is_available {
            return Err(LibraryError::BookNotAvailable);
        }
        
        // Find the user
        if !self.users.iter().any(|user| user.id == user_id) {
            return Err(LibraryError::UserNotFound);
        }
        
        // Mark the book as borrowed
        book.is_available = false;
        book.borrowed_by = Some(user_id);
        
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### Key points to understand

- `Result<T, E>` represents either success (Ok) with a value of type T or failure (Err) with an error of type E
- `Option<T>` represents either Some value or None
- The `?` operator provides a concise way to propagate errors
- Custom error types help create more meaningful error messages

### Common pitfalls

- Using `unwrap()` or `expect()` in production code
- Not providing enough context in error messages
- Creating overly complex error handling that obscures the main logic

## Collections

### Overview

Rust's standard library provides several collection types that store multiple values. The most common are Vec (vector), HashMap, and HashSet, each with different performance characteristics and use cases.

### How it's used in this project

The Library Management System uses collections to store and manage books and users.

```rust
pub struct Library {
    books: Vec<Book>,
    users: Vec<User>,
}

impl Library {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            books: Vec::new(),
            users: Vec::new(),
        }
    }
    
    pub fn search_books_by_author(&self, author: &str) -> Vec<&Book> {
        self.books
            .iter()
            .filter(|book| book.author.contains(author))
            .collect()
    }
}
```

### Key points to understand

- `Vec<T>` is a growable array type
- Collections own the data they contain
- Iterators provide a powerful way to process collections
- Collections can be borrowed immutably by multiple parts of code or mutably by one part

### Common pitfalls

- Not understanding the performance characteristics of different collections
- Inefficient searching or processing of collections
- Ownership issues when working with collections of owned values
