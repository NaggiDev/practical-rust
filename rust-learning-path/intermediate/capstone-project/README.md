# Intermediate Level Capstone Project: Distributed Task Queue System

## Project Overview

This capstone project combines all the concepts learned in the Intermediate Level by building a distributed task queue system. The system allows clients to submit tasks, distributes them across multiple worker threads, and provides real-time monitoring of task execution with persistent storage.

## Learning Objectives

This project integrates and reinforces all Intermediate Level concepts:

- **Advanced Ownership**: Complex lifetime management, shared ownership with `Arc`/`Rc`, interior mutability
- **Traits and Generics**: Generic task definitions, trait objects for polymorphism, custom trait implementations
- **Collections and Concurrency**: Multi-threaded task processing, thread-safe collections, channel communication
- **Error Handling Patterns**: Custom error types, error conversion chains, robust error propagation

## System Architecture

The system consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Task Queue**: Thread-safe queue for pending tasks
2. **Worker Pool**: Configurable number of worker threads
3. **Task Registry**: Persistent storage for task definitions and results
4. **Monitoring System**: Real-time status tracking and reporting
5. **Client Interface**: CLI and programmatic API for task submission

## Key Features

- **Generic Task System**: Support for any task type implementing the `Task` trait
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks and results stored in JSON format with error recovery
- **Concurrent Execution**: Multiple worker threads processing tasks simultaneously
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live status updates and progress tracking
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types with detailed context
- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup and graceful shutdown

## Prerequisites

Before starting this capstone project, you must have completed:
- Module 1: Advanced Ownership (Library Management System)
- Module 2: Traits and Generics (Custom Data Structure)
- Module 3: Collections and Concurrency (Multi-threaded Web Scraper)
- Module 4: Error Handling Patterns (CLI Database Tool)

**Deliverables**:
- `Task` trait definition with generic associated types
- Thread-safe task queue implementation
- Basic task registry with persistence

### Phase 2: Worker Pool System (Concurrency + Collections)

**Objective**: Implement multi-threaded task processing with proper synchronization.

**Key Concepts Applied**:
- Thread pool management and lifecycle
- Channel-based communication between threads
- Shared state synchronization with `Arc<Mutex<T>>`
- Concurrent collections for task distribution

**Deliverables**:
- Configurable worker thread pool
- Task distribution and load balancing
- Thread-safe result collection

### Phase 3: Monitoring and Storage (Error Handling + Persistence)

**Objective**: Add comprehensive monitoring and robust error handling.

## Getting Started

1. **Review Prerequisites**: Ensure you've completed all previous intermediate modules
2. **Read the Concepts Guide**: Study `CONCEPTS.md` for detailed explanations
3. **Start with Phase 1**: Follow the step-by-step implementation guide
4. **Run Tests Frequently**: Use `cargo test` to validate your progress
5. **Try Examples**: Run example programs to see the system in action

## Example Usage

```rust
use capstone_project::{TaskQueue, WorkerPool, Task};

// Define a custom task
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct MathTask {
    operation: String,
    operands: Vec<i32>,
}

impl Task for MathTask {
    type Output = i32;
    type Error = String;
    
    fn execute(&self) -> Result<Self::Output, Self::Error> {
        match self.operation.as_str() {
            "sum" => Ok(self.operands.iter().sum()),
            "product" => Ok(self.operands.iter().product()),
            _ => Err(format!("Unknown operation: {}", self.operation)),
        }
    }
}

// Use the task queue system
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let queue = TaskQueue::new();
    let pool = WorkerPool::new(4)?; // 4 worker threads
    
    // Submit tasks
    let task1 = MathTask {
        operation: "sum".to_string(),
        operands: vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    };
    
    let task_id = queue.submit(task1)?;
    
    // Start processing
    pool.start_processing(&queue)?;
    
    // Monitor progress
    let result = queue.wait_for_result(task_id)?;
    println!("Task result: {:?}", result);
    
    Ok(())
}
```
