## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Project Setup and Basic Structure

**Objective**: Set up the project with necessary dependencies and basic structure.

**Tasks**:
1. Initialize the Cargo project with performance-focused dependencies
2. Create the basic module structure
3. Set up benchmarking infrastructure
4. Create sample datasets for testing

**Concepts Applied**:
- Cargo workspace configuration
- Performance-oriented dependency selection
- Benchmark setup with Criterion

**Implementation**:

Start by examining the `Cargo.toml` file to understand the dependencies:

```toml
[package]
name = "high-performance-data-processing"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
rayon = "1.7"           # Parallel processing
memmap2 = "0.9"         # Memory-mapped files
csv = "1.3"             # CSV parsing
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
bytemuck = "1.14"       # Safe transmutation
wide = "0.7"            # SIMD operations
clap = { version = "4.4", features = ["derive"] }
anyhow = "1.0"          # Error handling

[dev-dependencies]
criterion = { version = "0.5", features = ["html_reports"] }
tempfile = "3.8"

[[bench]]
name = "processor_bench"
harness = false

[profile.release]
lto = true              # Link-time optimization
codegen-units = 1       # Single codegen unit for better optimization
panic = "abort"         # Smaller binary size
```

**TODO**: Implement the basic project structure and module exports in `src/lib.rs`.

### Step 2: Memory-Mapped File Processing

**Objective**: Implement efficient file I/O using memory-mapped files for processing large datasets.

**Tasks**:
1. Create a memory-mapped file reader
2. Implement zero-copy data access patterns
3. Handle large files that don't fit in memory
4. Add error handling for file operations

**Concepts Applied**:
- Memory-mapped I/O
- Zero-copy operations
- Virtual memory management
- Error handling for system resources

**TODO**: Implement the `MemoryMappedProcessor` in `src/memory_map.rs`.

### Step 3: SIMD Operations Implementation

**Objective**: Implement vectorized operations using SIMD instructions for data processing.

**Tasks**:
1. Create SIMD-optimized mathematical operations
2. Implement data transformation functions
3. Add fallback implementations for non-SIMD targets
4. Benchmark SIMD vs scalar performance

**Concepts Applied**:
- SIMD programming
- Vectorization techniques

## Performance Targets

Your implementation should achieve the following performance characteristics:

- **Memory Efficiency**: Use no more than 10% additional memory beyond the dataset size
- **Scalability**: Linear performance scaling with CPU core count
- **Latency**: Sub-millisecond processing latency for small datasets

## Extension Challenges

1. **GPU Acceleration**: Implement GPU-accelerated processing using compute shaders
2. **Network Processing**: Add support for streaming data processing over network
3. **Compression**: Implement on-the-fly compression/decompression
4. **Custom Allocators**: Use custom memory allocators for specific workloads
5. **Real-time Processing**: Add real-time data processing capabilities

## Testing and Validation

Run the following commands to test your implementation:

```bash
# Run unit tests
cargo test

# Run performance tests
cargo test --release performance_tests

# Run benchmarks
cargo bench

# Profile with perf (Linux)
cargo build --release
perf record --call-graph=dwarf ./target/release/high-performance-data-processing --input data/sample_large.csv
perf report
```
