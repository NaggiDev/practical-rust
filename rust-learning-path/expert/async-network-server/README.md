# Asynchronous Network Server

## Project Overview

Build a high-performance asynchronous network server using Rust's async/await syntax and the Tokio runtime. This project demonstrates advanced async programming concepts including futures, async I/O, connection handling, and runtime management.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will understand:
- Async/await syntax and futures in Rust
- Tokio runtime and its components
- Asynchronous I/O operations
- Connection pooling and management
- Error handling in async contexts
- Performance considerations for async servers

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Advanced Level projects
- Understanding of networking concepts (TCP/IP, HTTP)
- Familiarity with Rust's ownership system and error handling
- Basic knowledge of concurrent programming

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Project Setup and Basic Server Structure
- Set up the Cargo project with Tokio dependencies
- Create the basic server structure with async main function
- Implement a simple TCP listener that accepts connections
- **Concepts Applied**: Async functions, Tokio runtime, TCP listeners

### Step 2: Connection Handling and Async I/O
- Implement connection handling with async read/write operations
- Add proper connection lifecycle management
- Handle multiple concurrent connections
- **Concepts Applied**: Async I/O, connection management, concurrent tasks

### Step 3: Request Processing and Response Generation
- Parse incoming HTTP requests asynchronously
- Implement request routing and handler dispatch
- Generate appropriate HTTP responses
- **Concepts Applied**: Async parsing, pattern matching, HTTP protocol

### Step 4: Error Handling and Graceful Shutdown
- Implement comprehensive error handling for async operations
- Add graceful shutdown mechanisms
- Handle connection errors and timeouts
- **Concepts Applied**: Async error handling, signal handling, resource cleanup

### Step 5: Performance Optimization and Monitoring
- Add connection pooling and resource management
- Implement basic metrics and monitoring
- Optimize for high concurrency scenarios
- **Concepts Applied**: Performance optimization, resource management, async monitoring

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd rust-learning-path/expert/async-network-server
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

3. Run the server:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

4. Test the server:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/
   ```

5. Run tests:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

## Extension Challenges

Once you complete the basic implementation, try these extensions:

1. **WebSocket Support**: Add WebSocket protocol support for real-time communication
2. **HTTP/2 Implementation**: Upgrade to HTTP/2 with multiplexing support
3. **TLS/SSL Support**: Add HTTPS support with certificate management
4. **Load Balancing**: Implement basic load balancing between multiple backend services
5. **Middleware System**: Create a flexible middleware system for request processing
6. **Database Integration**: Add async database operations with connection pooling
7. **Metrics Dashboard**: Build a real-time metrics dashboard using WebSockets
