# Compiler Plugin Project

## Learning Objectives

In this project, you'll learn how to create a Rust compiler plugin that extends the compiler's functionality. You'll understand:

- How to work with the Rust compiler's internal APIs
- Creating procedural macros that interact with compiler internals
- Understanding the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and token streams
- Implementing custom lints and compiler diagnostics
- Working with compiler attributes and metadata

## Project Overview

You'll build a compiler plugin that provides custom linting functionality. The plugin will:

1. Detect specific code patterns that should be flagged
2. Provide helpful diagnostic messages
3. Suggest fixes for common issues
4. Integrate with the standard Rust compilation process

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Advanced Level modules
- Understanding of macros and procedural macros
- Familiarity with Rust's type system and traits
- Basic knowledge of compiler theory concepts

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Project Setup and Basic Structure

**Objective**: Set up the project structure and basic plugin framework.

**Tasks**:
1. Create the Cargo.toml with necessary dependencies
2. Set up the basic plugin structure in lib.rs
3. Create placeholder modules for lints and diagnostics

**Concepts Applied**:
- Procedural macro crates
- Compiler plugin architecture
- Cargo workspace configuration

**Implementation**:

Start by examining the provided Cargo.toml and lib.rs files. Notice how we declare this as a procedural macro crate and import the necessary compiler APIs.

### Step 2: Implement Basic Lint Detection

**Objective**: Create a simple lint that detects a specific code pattern.

**Tasks**:
1. Implement a lint that detects unused variables with specific naming patterns
2. Create the basic visitor pattern for AST traversal
3. Generate appropriate diagnostic messages

**Concepts Applied**:
- AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) traversal
- Visitor pattern in compiler design
- Diagnostic generation and reporting

**Implementation**:

Examine the lint.rs file to understand how to traverse the AST and detect patterns. The visitor pattern is crucial for efficiently examining code structures.

### Step 3: Advanced Lint Implementation

**Objective**: Implement more sophisticated linting rules.

**Tasks**:
1. Create a lint that detects potential performance issues
2. Implement a lint for code style consistency
3. Add configurable lint levels and options

**Concepts Applied**:
- Complex AST pattern matching
- Performance analysis in static analysis
- Configurable compiler plugins

**Implementation**:

Build upon the basic lint structure to create more complex analysis. Focus on understanding how to analyze code for performance implications.

### Step 4: Diagnostic Enhancement

**Objective**: Improve diagnostic messages and add fix suggestions.

**Tasks**:
1. Implement rich diagnostic messages with code spans
2. Add suggested fixes for detected issues
3. Create multi-span diagnostics for complex issues

**Concepts Applied**:
- Compiler diagnostic system
- Code span management
- Automated fix suggestions

**Implementation**:

Work with the diagnostics.rs file to understand how to create helpful, actionable diagnostic messages that guide developers to solutions.

### Step 5: Integration and Testing

**Objective**: Create comprehensive tests and ensure proper integration.

**Tasks**:
1. Write integration tests that compile test code with the plugin
2. Create test cases for both positive and negative scenarios
3. Test the plugin with real-world code examples

**Concepts Applied**:
- Compiler plugin testing strategies
- Integration testing with compilation
- Test-driven development for compiler tools

**Implementation**:

Examine the test structure to understand how to test compiler plugins effectively. This includes testing both the detection of issues and the absence of false positives.

### Step 6: Documentation and Usage

**Objective**: Document the plugin and create usage examples.

**Tasks**:
1. Document all lint rules and their purposes
2. Create examples of code that triggers each lint
3. Provide integration instructions for other projects

**Concepts Applied**:
- Technical documentation for developer tools
- Plugin distribution and integration
- User experience for developer tools

## Extension Challenges

Once you've completed the basic implementation, try these additional challenges:

1. **Custom Attribute Support**: Add support for custom attributes that configure lint behavior
2. **IDE Integration**: Research how to integrate your plugin with IDE tools
3. **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize your plugin for large codebases
4. **Cross-Crate Analysis**: Extend the plugin to analyze dependencies
5. **Custom Derive Integration**: Create a derive macro that works with your lints

## Testing Your Implementation

Run the tests to verify your implementation:

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run integration tests specifically
cargo test --test integration_tests

# Test the plugin with example code
cargo check --example usage
```

## Key Learning Points

By completing this project, you should understand:

- How Rust's compiler architecture enables extensibility
