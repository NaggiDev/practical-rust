# Expert Level - Specialized Rust Applications

Welcome to the Expert Level of the Rust Learning Path! This level focuses on specialized Rust applications and advanced topics that will elevate you to Rust expertise.

## Prerequisites

- Completion of the [Advanced Level](../advanced/index.md)
- Deep understanding of Rust's memory model and ownership system
- Experience with concurrent programming in Rust
- Familiarity with unsafe Rust and FFI
- Comfort with macros and metaprogramming

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this level, you will:

- Master asynchronous programming in Rust
- Understand and implement custom async runtimes
- Work with compiler internals and create compiler plugins
- Optimize Rust code for maximum performance
- Design and implement high-throughput systems
- Create custom language tooling
- Develop advanced memory management techniques

## Modules

### [Module 1: Async Programming](module1/index.md)

Master futures, async/await, and asynchronous programming patterns.

**Projects:**
- [Asynchronous Network Server](module1/async-server/README.md)

### [Module 2: Custom Runtimes](module2/index.md)

Understand how async runtimes work by building your own.

**Projects:**
- [Custom Runtime Implementation](module2/custom-runtime/README.md)

### [Module 3: Compiler Internals](module3/index.md)

Dive deep into the Rust compiler and create extensions.

**Projects:**
- [Compiler Plugin Development](module3/compiler-plugin/README.md)

### [Module 4: Performance Optimization](module4/index.md)

Master techniques for writing high-performance Rust code.

**Projects:**
- [High-Performance Data Processing Pipeline](module4/data-processing/README.md)

### [Module 5: Capstone Project](module5/index.md)

Apply all the concepts learned in the Expert Level to build a comprehensive project.

**Projects:**
- [Expert Level Capstone Project](module5/capstone/README.md)

## Next Steps

After completing the Expert Level, you will have mastered Rust and be equipped to:

- Contribute to the Rust ecosystem
- Develop high-performance systems
